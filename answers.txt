I love Twinkies, and the reason I am saying that is because we are all
supposed to think of reasons to live.
In science class, Mr. As. told us about an experiment where they got this rat
or mouse and they put this rat or mouse on one side of a cage.
On the other side of the cage, they put a little piece of food.
And this rat or mouse would walk over to the food and eat.
Then, they put the rat or mouse back on xsdc original side, and this time
they put electricity all through the floor where the rat or mouse would
have to walk to get the piece of food.
They did this for a while, and the rat or mouse stopped going to get the food
at a certain amount of voltage.
Then, they repeated the experiment, but they replaced the food with something
that gave the rat or mouse intense pleasure.
I donâ€™t know what it was that gave them intense pleasure, but I am guessing it
is some kind of rat or mouse nip.
Anyway, what the scientists found out was that the rat or mouse would put up
with a lot more voltage for the pleasure.
Even more than for the food.
